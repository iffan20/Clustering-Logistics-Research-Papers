### Introduction

In the field of logistics, research studies are growing rapidly in Thailand, covering various aspects such as supply chain management, transportation, and logistics systems. However, many of these research papers are scattered and lack organization based on their key themes and concepts. This makes it challenging for students, researchers, and industry professionals to easily access relevant information and trends within specific logistics topics.

This project aims to cluster Thai logistics research papers based on their abstracts, enabling an organized categorization of research into meaningful groups. By applying natural language processing (NLP) and clustering techniques, the goal is to identify major themes within the research and highlight emerging trends in the field. This will help researchers and industry professionals quickly navigate the growing body of Thai logistics research and provide insights into areas that require further exploration.
